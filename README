This was supposed to be a "Hello World" app in Python for GAE. I wrote this to
learn python & GAE envronment at the same time. Even though the initial idea was
simple, it evolved in to something more than just simple. Regardless, it is not a
complex app and is very much usable. I used Hacker Dojo (http://hackerdojo.com) as
an example site (in fact they need something like this anyway).

It touches various aspects of GAE like datastores, memcache, url fetch etc. It
uses jQcloud (https://github.com/DukeLeNoir/jQCloud) to generate tag cloud &
tag-it Jquery plugin (http://plugins.jquery.com/project/tag-it) - although I
modified it tiny bit to fit my purpose.
